abstract = {Kilometer-scale lenses of quartz-rich metasedimentary rocks crop out in a discontinuous belt along the southern margin of the Menderes Massif, Turkey, and preserve evidence for high-pressure-low-temperature (H. P-L. T) metamorphism related to subduction of a continental margin during Alpine orogeny. Kyanite schist, quartzite, and quartz veins contain kyanite. +. phengite. +. Mg-chlorite, and the veins also contain magnesiocarpholite. A deformed carbonate metaconglomerate juxtaposed with the quartzite-dominated unit does not contain H. P index minerals, and likely represents the tectonized boundary of the siliceous rocks with adjacent marble. The H. P-L. T rocks (10-12kbar, 470-570Â°C) record different pressure conditions than the adjacent, apparently lower pressure Menderes metasedimentary sequence. Despite this difference there is disagreement as to whether these H. P-L. T rocks are part of the Menderes sequence or are related to the tectonically overlying Cycladic blueschist unit. If the former, the entire southern Menderes Massif experienced H. P-L. T metamorphism but the evidence has been obliterated from most rocks; if the latter, rocks recording different metamorphic-kinematic conditions experienced different tectonic histories and were tectonically juxtaposed during thrusting. Based on observations and data in this study, the second model better accounts for the differences in P- T-deformation histories of the southern Menderes Massif rocks, and suggests that the H. P-L. T rocks are not part of the Menderes cover sequence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gluteal augmentation surgery has grown by 42 {\%} per year; however, the epidemiological profile of patients who seek this treatment has never been studied. OBJECTIVE: To establish the epidemiological profile of patients who have undergone gluteoplasty surgery, evaluating their level of satisfaction and the social impact caused by the surgery. METHODS: Fifty patients, with ages ranging from 23 to 57 years replied to a specific questionnaire and the esthetic result of the surgery was evaluated. Thirty-seven patients were analyzed prospectively, using CT scans and gluteal reconstruction. The esthetic result was evaluated by eight plastic surgeon specialists from SBCP. RESULTS: About satisfaction and quality of life, 98 {\%} of the patients demonstrated improvement in some aspect of life. Analysis of the marital status of patients showed that 24 {\%} of them have changed it. Therefore, all cases showed positive correlations between implant size and monthly income, age and satisfaction of patients. There has also been a positive correlation between implant size and recovery time. There was no statistically significant correlation between the esthetic result and the implant volume or the anthropometric measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological profile of patients undergoing gluteoplasty augmentation with implants is predominantly white skin, 36 years old, unrelated to the occupation or socioeconomic status. Augmentation gluteoplasty with implants is a surgery with a high level of satisfaction to patients, improving life in many aspects but, mainly, affectively. Its outcome produces a natural look and is hardly noticed by others. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE V: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enhancement of buttock volume with gluteal silicone implants has been performed by surgeons for over 30 years, but no studies have examined complication rates or outcomes of more than single-surgeon experiences. Numerous technical differences in how gluteal augmentation surgery with implants is performed also exist, and to date, surgeon preferences for implant plane, incisional access, implant type, and drain use have not been quantified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A 10-question survey was sent to 83 targeted members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons requesting information about number of cases performed, duration of surgeon experience, implant placement plane and incisional access, implant type, length of typical surgery, use of drains and antibiotic irrigation solution, surgeon satisfaction and surgeon assessment of patient satisfaction, and number of complications experienced.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen respondents (25 percent response rate) provided data on 2226 patients. Thirteen respondents (68.4 percent) favored the intramuscular plane of dissection over the subfascial plane. Preference for incisional access was nearly equally divided between a single incision in the gluteal cleft (10 respondents) and two incisions separated within the cleft (nine respondents). The total number of complications reported was 848 (38.1 percent).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Gluteal augmentation with silicone implants has gained popularity in the last decade. Despite this, no previous studies have examined multisurgeon experiences with this procedure to determine complication rates or surgeon technical preferences. The authors present data from a survey sent to experienced gluteal augmentation surgeons. Advances in technique and implant options are needed to improve complication rates experienced with this procedure.},

abstract = {Background Many studies of gluteal augmentation techniques have been published in recent decades, including case reports, retrospective and prospective case series, and multicenter survey reviews. However, to date, there has been no study of the overall complications or satisfaction rates associated with the broad spectrum of techniques. Objectives The authors performed a comprehensive literature review to determine outcomes and complications of gluteoplasty techniques, including patient satisfaction. Methods A search on PubMed/Medline was performed for clinical studies involving gluteal augmentation techniques. A priori criteria were used to review the resulting articles. Results Fifty-two studies, published from 1969 through 2015, were included - representing 7834 treated patients. Five gluteal augmentation techniques were identified from these studies: gluteal augmentation with implants (n = 4781), autologous fat grafting (n = 2609), local flaps (n = 369), hyaluronic acid gel injection (n = 69), and local tissue rearrangement (n = 6). The overall complication rates of the most commonly utilized techniques were: 30.5{\%} for gluteal augmentation with implants, 10.5{\%} for autologous fat grafting, and 22{\%} for local flaps. Patients' satisfaction was reported as consistently high for all the five techniques. Conclusions Implant-based gluteal augmentation is associated with high patients' satisfaction despite a high complication rate, while autologous fat grafting is associated with the lowest complication rate yet including serious major complications such as fat embolism. Local flaps and local tissue rearrangements are the ideal procedures in case of massive weight loss patients. A paucity of data is available for hyaluronic acid gel injections, which appear to be effective but temporary and expensive. Level of Evidence 4},

abstract = {CT is the most important source of exposures to radiation in most developed countries today. For this reason CT dose optimisation is of great importance. In this position paper four main stakeholders who are involved in CT dose optimisation are identified. These are the CT manufacturers, the medical doctors, the CT technologists and the medical physicists. HERCA has been working together with the CT manufacturers and COCIR since 2010 following a selfcommitment provided by COCIR in 2011. A number of dose optimisation and management tools have been developed by the CT manufacturers and are now available on modern CT scanners. These are presented in this paper. The process of CT dose optimisation can only be achieved if all the stakeholders involved work together as a team and are educated and trained in the use of CT dose optimisation and management tools. The CT manufacturers have an important role in this process. They need to ensure that their staff is properly trained, they need to provide proper education and training to the other three stakeholders involved and these three stakeholders need to find the time and be willing to be trained. This is clearly stated in this position paper with the aim of ensuring appropriate and effective use of CT imaging equipment.},

abstract = {A new UK computed tomography (CT) survey has provided a useful snapshot of patient doses for 2003. Scan details for nearly 850 standard protocols and 2,000 individual patients relating to 12 common CT examinations on adults and children were collected by questionnaires voluntarily submitted by a widelydistributed sample of 126 scanners. This represented more than a quarter of all UK scanners and included 37{\%} with multislice capability. Scanner-specific normalised CT dose data published by ImPACT were used to estimate standard dose indices CTDIw and CTDIvol for each sequence and, with knowledge of scan lengths, DLP for each examination. Effective doses were subsequently estimated from the calculated values of DLP. Wide variations in practice were still apparent between CT centres, although the overall levels of exposure were in general lower by 10-40{\%} than previous UK survey data for 1991. There was, however, an apparent trend for slightly increased doses from multislice (4+) (MSCT) relative to single slice (SSCT) scanners for adult patients. Values of CTDIvol were broadly similar to recent survey data for MSCT from Europe for 2001. Effective doses to very young patients (aged 0-1 years) were typically higher than corresponding values for adults. Doses to individual patients were on average similar to those for the standard protocols established for each scanner, although significant variations were also apparent. The report includes summaries of the dose distributions observed and, on the basis of third quartile values, presents national reference doses for examinations on adults (separately for SSCT and MSCT) and children. The PREDICT (Patient Radiation Exposure and Dose in CT) database established by the survey represents a sustainable national resource for monitoring continuing developments in CT through the ongoing collation of further survey data.},

abstract = {Multi-slice (MS) technology increases the efficacy of CT procedures and offers new promising applications. The expanding use of MSCT, however, may result in an increase in both frequency of procedures and levels of patient exposure. It was, therefore, the aim of this study to gain an overview of MSCT examinations conducted in Germany in 2001. All MSCT facilities were requested to provide information about 14 standard examinations with respect to scan parameters and frequency. Based on this data, dosimetric quantities were estimated using an experimentally validated formalism. Results are compared with those of a previous survey for single-slice (SS) spiral CT scanners. According to the data provided for 39 dual- and 73 quad-slice systems, the average annual number of patients examined at MSCT is markedly higher than that examined at SSCT scanners (5500 vs 3500). The average effective dose to patients was changed from 7.4 mSv at single-slice to 5.5 mSv and 8.1 mSv at dual- and quad-slice scanners, respectively. There is a considerable potential for dose reduction at quad-slice systems by an optimisation of scan protocols and better education of the personnel. To avoid an increase in the collective effective dose from CT procedures, a clear medical justification is required in each case.},

abstract = {We review the evolution of human bipedal locomotion with a particular emphasis on the evolution of the foot. We begin in the early twentieth century and focus particularly on hypotheses of an ape-like ancestor for humans and human bipedal locomotion put forward by a succession of Gregory, Keith, Morton and Schultz. We give consideration to Morton's (1935) synthesis of foot evolution, in which he argues that the foot of the common ancestor of modern humans and the African apes would be intermediate between the foot of Pan and Hylobates whereas the foot of a hypothetical early hominin would be intermediate between that of a gorilla and a modern human. From this base rooted in comparative anatomy of living primates we trace changing ideas about the evolution of human bipedalism as increasing amounts of postcranial fossil material were discovered. Attention is given to the work of John Napier and John Robinson who were pioneers in the interpretation of Plio-Pleistocene hominin skeletons in the 1960s. This is the period when the wealth of evidence from the southern African australopithecine sites was beginning to be appreciated and Olduvai Gorge was revealing its first evidence for Homo habilis. In more recent years, the discovery of the Laetoli footprint trail, the AL 288-1 (A. afarensis) skeleton, the wealth of postcranial material from Koobi Fora, the Nariokotome Homo ergaster skeleton, Little Foot (Stw 573) from Sterkfontein in South Africa, and more recently tantalizing material assigned to the new and very early taxa Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus ramidus and Sahelanthropus tchadensis has fuelled debate and speculation. The varying interpretations based on this material, together with changing theoretical insights and analytical approaches, is discussed and assessed in the context of new three-dimensional morphometric analyses of australopithecine and Homo foot bones, suggesting that there may have been greater diversity in human bipedalism in the earlier phases of our evolutionary history than previously suspected.},

abstract = {Intensity normalization is an important pre-processing step in the study and analysis of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of human brains. As most parametric supervised automatic image segmentation and classification methods base their assumptions regarding the intensity distributions on a standardized intensity range, intensity normalization takes on a very significant role. One of the fast and accurate approaches proposed for intensity normalization is that of Nyul and colleagues. In this work, we present, for the first time, an extensive validation of this approach in real clinical domain where even after intensity inhomogeneity correction that accounts for scanner-specific artifacts, the MRI volumes can be affected from variations such as data heterogeneity resulting from multi-site multi-scanner acquisitions, the presence of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and the stage of disease progression in the brain. Using the distributional divergence criteria, we evaluate the effectiveness of the normalization in rendering, under the distributional assumptions of segmentation approaches, intensities that are more homogenous for the same tissue type while simultaneously resulting in better tissue type separation. We also demonstrate the advantage of the decile based piece-wise linear approach on the task of MS lesion segmentation against a linear normalization approach over three image segmentation algorithms: a standard Bayesian classifier, an outlier detection based approach and a Bayesian classifier with Markov Random Field (MRF) based post-processing. Finally, to demonstrate the independence of the effectiveness of normalization from the complexity of segmentation algorithm, we evaluate the Nyul method against the linear normalization on Bayesian algorithms of increasing complexity including a standard Bayesian classifier with Maximum Likelihood parameter estimation and a Bayesian classifier with integrated data priors, in addition to the above Bayesian classifier with MRF based post-processing to smooth the posteriors. In all relevant cases, the observed results are verified for statistical relevance using significance tests. 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Microbial keratitis is a serious sight threatening infection affecting approximately two million individuals worldwide annually. While antibiotic eye drops remain the gold standard treatment for these infections, the significant problems associated with eye drop drug delivery and the alarming rise in antimicrobial resistance has meant that there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments. In this work, a nitric oxide releasing contact lens gel displaying broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against two of the most common causative pathogens of microbial keratitis is described. The contact lens gel is composed of poly-Ïµ-lysine (pÏµK) functionalized with nitric oxide (NO) releasing diazeniumdiolate moieties which enables the controlled and sustained release of bactericidal concentrations of NO at physiological pH over a period of 15 h. Diazeniumdiolate functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and the concentration of NO released from the gels was determined by chemiluminescence. The bactericidal efficacy of the gels against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was ascertained, and between 1 and 4 log reductions in bacterial populations were observed over 24 h. Additional cell cytotoxicity studies with human corneal epithelial cells (hCE-T) also demonstrated that the contact lens gels were not cytotoxic, suggesting that the developed technology could be a viable alternative treatment for microbial keratitis.},

Convolutional neural networks (CNN), demonstrate success in generalizing to variable data, illustrating great potential as a solution to the problem of data variability. In some CNN-based segmentation works for digital pathology, authors apply color normalization (CN) to reduce color variability of data as a preprocessing step prior to prediction, while others do not. Both approaches achieve reasonable performance and yet, the reasoning for utilizing this step has not been justified. It is therefore important to evaluate the necessity and impact of CN for deep learning frameworks, and its effect on downstream processes. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of popular CN methods on CNN-based nuclei segmentation frameworks.},

By reparameterizing the weights in this way we improve the conditioning of the optimization problem and we speed up convergence of stochastic gradient descent. Our reparameterization is inspired by batch normalization but does not introduce any dependencies between the examples in a minibatch. This means that our method can also be applied successfully to recurrent models such as LSTMs and to noise-sensitive applications such as deep reinforcement learning or generative models, for which batch normalization is less well suited. Although our method is much simpler, it still provides much of the speed-up of full batch normalization. In addition, the computational overhead of our method is lower, permitting more optimization steps to be taken in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on applications in supervised image recognition, generative modelling, and deep reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Image texture is a very important component in many types of images, including medical images. Medical images are often corrupted by noise and affected by artifacts. Some of the texture-based features that should describe the structure of the tissue under examination may also reflect, for example, the uneven sensitivity of the scanner within the tissue region. This in turn may lead to an inappropriate description of the tissue or incorrect classification. To limit these phenomena, the analyzed regions of interest are normalized. In texture analysis methods, image intensity normalization is usually followed by a reduction in the number of levels coding the intensity. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of different image normalization methods and the number of intensity levels on texture classification, taking into account noise and artifacts related to uneven background brightness distribution. Analyses were performed on four sets of images: modified Brodatz textures, kidney images obtained by means of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, shoulder images acquired as T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and CT heart and thorax images. The results will be of use for choosing a particular method of image normalization, based on the types of noise and distortion present in the images.},

abstract = {As the most frequent cause of physical disability, musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis and osteoporosis have a great social and economical impact. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers are important tools that allow clinicians to better characterize, monitor, and even predict musculoskeletal disease progression. Post-processing pipelines often include image segmentation. Manually identifying the border of the region of interest (ROI) is a difficult and time-consuming task. Manual segmentation is also affected by inter- and intrauser variability, thus limiting standardization. Fully automatic or semi-automatic methods that minimize the user interaction are highly desirable. Unfortunately, an ultimate, highly reliable and extensively evaluated solution for joint and musculoskeletal tissue segmentation has not yet been proposed, and many clinical studies still adopt fully manual procedures. Moreover, the clinical translation of several promising quantitative MRI techniques is highly affected by the lack of an established, fast, and accurate segmentation method. The goal of this review is to present some of the techniques proposed in recent literature that have been adopted in clinical studies for joint and musculoskeletal tissue analyses in arthritis patients. The most widely used MRI sequences and image processing algorithms employed to accomplish segmentation challenges will be discussed in this paper.},

Comparing the model of healthy individuals and the patient with joint damage leads to a subject-specific convalescence treatment. This work describes the procedure for segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulder joint. Firstly three bones inside the shoulder area: humerus, clavicle, scapula are identified and thereby it provides initial reference objects. A major step is the segmentation of the deltoid muscle needed for the subsequent adaptation of the musculoskeletal model. This step is challenging in terms of image processing due to the closeness of soft tissues, which are almost identical in intensity and the boundaries between them are often barely visible. The approach to resolving this problem is described and possible improvements and future work are described.},

abstract = {The preparation and characterization of blended solid polymer electrolyte 49{\%} poly(methyl methacrylate)- grafted natural rubber (MG49):poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (30:70) were carried out. The effect of lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF 4) concentration on the chemical interaction, structure, morphology, and room temperature conductivity of the electrolyte were investigated. The electrolyte samples with various weight percentages (wt. {\%}) of LiBF 4 salt were prepared by solution casting technique and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Infrared analysis demonstrated that the interaction between lithium ions and oxygen atoms occurred at symmetrical stretching of carbonyl (C=O) (1,735 cm -1) and asymmetric deformation of (O-CH 3) (1,456 cm -1) via the formation of coordinate bond on MMA structure in MG49 and PMMA. The reduction of MMA peaks intensity at the diffraction angle, 2$\theta$ of 29.5Â° and 39.5Â° was due to the increase in weight percent of LiBF 4. The complexation occurred between the salt and polymer host had been confirmed by the XRD analysis. The semi-crystalline phase of polymer host was found to reduce with the increase in salt content and confirmed by XRD analysis. Morphological studies by SEM showed that MG49 blended with PMMA was compatible. The addition of salt into the blend has changed the topological order of the polymer host from dark surface to brighter surface. The SEM analyses supported the enhancement of conductivity with the addition of salt. The conductivity increased drastically from 2.0 to 3.4Ã 10 -5S cm -1 with the addition of 25 wt.{\%} of salt. The increase in the conductivity was due to the increasing of the number of charge carriers in the electrolyte. The conductivity obeys Arrhenius equation in higher temperature region from 333 to 373 K with the pre-exponential factor $\sigma$ o of 1.21Ã10 -7 S cm -1 and the activation energy E a of 0.46 eV.

METHODS: A total of 3817 people aged 75 years and older, including 173 MÄori aged 61 years and older, were surveyed. Measures included: sociodemographic and health factors; World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL)-BREF for QOL; and self-rated hearing- and vision-related disability.
RESULTS: Hearing disability was reported by 866 (51{\%}) men and 736 (36{\%}) women. A total of 974 (26{\%} of all, 61{\%} of hearing disabled) used hearing aids. A total of 513 (30{\%}) men and 618 (30{\%}) women reported vision disability. Vision and hearing disability were both independently associated with lower QOL, with hearing difficulty affecting physical and social domains more, and the environmental domain least.

Manual and automated bone segmentations from shoulder MR examinations from 25 healthy subjects acquired using steady-state free precession sequences were compared with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The mean DSC scores between the manual and automated segmentations of the humerus and scapula bone volumes surrounding the BCI region were 0.926 Â± 0.050 and 0.837 Â± 0.059, respectively. The mean DSC values obtained for BCI extraction were 0.806 Â± 0.133 for the humerus and 0.795 Â± 0.117 for the scapula. The current model-based approach successfully provided automated bone segmentation and BCI extraction from MR images of the shoulder. In future work, this framework appears to provide a promising avenue for automated segmentation and quantitative analysis of cartilage in the glenohumeral joint.},

@article{Taghizadeh2020,
abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed at developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) able to automatically quantify and characterize the level of degeneration of rotator cuff (RC) muscles from shoulder CT images including muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration. Methods: One hundred three shoulder CT scans from 95 patients with primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis undergoing anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty were retrospectively retrieved. Three independent radiologists manually segmented the premorbid boundaries of all four RC muscles on standardized sagittal-oblique CT sections. This premorbid muscle segmentation was further automatically predicted using a CNN. Automatically predicted premorbid segmentations were then used to quantify the ratio of muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, secondary bone formation, and overall muscle degeneration. These muscle parameters were compared with measures obtained manually by human raters. Results: Average Dice similarity coefficients for muscle segmentations obtained automatically with the CNN (88{\%} Â± 9{\%}) and manually by human raters (89{\%} Â± 6{\%}) were comparable. No significant differences were observed for the subscapularis, supraspinatus, and teres minor muscles (p 0.120), whereas Dice coefficients of the automatic segmentation were significantly higher for the infraspinatus (p 0.012). The automatic approach was able to provide goodâvery good estimates of muscle atrophy (R2 = 0.87), fatty infiltration (R2 = 0.91), and overall muscle degeneration (R2 = 0.91). However, CNN-derived segmentations showed a higher variability in quantifying secondary bone formation (R2 = 0.61) than human raters (R2 = 0.87). Conclusions: Deep learning provides a rapid and reliable automatic quantification of RC muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, and overall muscle degeneration directly from preoperative shoulder CT scans of osteoarthritic patients, with an accuracy comparable with that of human raters. Key Points: â¢ Deep learning can not only segment RC muscles currently available in CT images but also learn their pre-existing locations and shapes from invariant anatomical structures visible on CT sections. â¢ Our automatic method is able to provide a rapid and reliable quantification of RC muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration from conventional shoulder CT scans. â¢ The accuracy of our automatic quantitative technique is comparable with that of human raters.},

Osteoporosis Australia continues to recommend a total daily calcium intake of 1,000-1,300 mg per day, depending on age and sex, and ideally obtained from calcium rich foods in the diet. However, when dietary intake of calcium is not sufficient, supplements may be required at a daily dose of around 500-600 mg per day. Calcium supplementation has also been an integral component of clinical trials with prescription medicines used to treat established osteoporosis. Calcium requirements The NHMRC Nutrient Reference Values (NRV) outline total calcium recommended per day. These requirements take into consideration factors such as calcium excreted from the body (and some calcium not properly absorbed) to ensure adequate intake for the majority of the population. An average diet should include 3-5 serves of calcium rich food daily. The number of serves is determined by calcium content. Calcium An annual review of a patient's dietary calcium intake can help improve overall calcium consumption. 1 More than half Australian adults do not reach recommended levels of calcium intake. 2 Supplementation Calcium (and vitamin D) supplementation has been shown to be effective in people who do not get enough dietary calcium (and/ or sunlight for vitamin D).

abstract = {Histological analyses of tissue biopsies is an essential component in the diagnosis of several diseases including cancer. In the past, evaluation of tissue samples was done manually, but to improve efficiency and ensure consistent quality, there has been a push to evaluate these algorithmically. One important task in histological analysis is the segmentation and evaluation of nuclei. Nuclear morphology is important to understand the grade and progression of disease. However, implementing automated methods at scale across histological datasets is challenging due to differences in stain, slide preparation and slide storage. This paper evaluates the impact of four stain normalization methods on the performance of nuclei segmentation algorithms. The goal is to highlight the critical role of stain normalization in improving the usability of learning-based models (such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) for this task. Using stain normalization, the baseline segmentation accuracy across distinct training and test datasets was improved by more than 50{\%} of its base value as measured by the AUC and Recall. We believe this is the first study to perform a comparative analysis of four stain normalization approaches (histogram equalization, Reinhart, Macenko, spline mapping) on segmentation accuracy of CNNs.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {Introduction: Convolutional neural networks have begun to surpass classical statistical- and atlas based machine learning techniques in medical image segmentation in recent years, proving to be superior in performance and speed. However, a major challenge that the community faces are mismatch between variability within training and evaluation datasets and therefore a dependency on proper data pre-processing. Intensity normalization is a widely applied technique for reducing the variance of the data for which there are several methods available ranging from uniformity transformation to histogram equalization. The current study analyses the influence of intensity normalization on cerebellum segmentation performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN). Method: The study included three population samples with a total number of 218 datasets, all including a T1w MRI data set acquired at 3 T and a ground truth segmentation delineating the cerebellum. A 12 layer deep 3D fully convolutional neural network was trained using 150 datasets from one of the population samples. Four different intensity normalization methods were separately applied to pre-process the data, and the CNN was correspondingly trained four times with respect to the different normalization techniques. A quantitative analysis of the segmentation performance, assessed via the S{\o}rensenâDice similarity coefficient (DSC) of all four CNNs, was performed to investigate the intensity sensitivity of the CNNs. Additionally, the optimal network performance was determined by identifying the best parameter set for intensity normalization. Results: All four normalization methods led to excellent (mean DSC score = 0.96) segmentation results when evaluated using known data; however, the segmentation performance differed depending on the applied intensity normalization method when testing with formerly unseen data, in which case the histogram equalization methods outperformed the unit distribution methods. A detailed, systematic analysis of intensity manipulations revealed, that the distribution of input intensities clearly affected the segmentation performance and that for each input dataset a linear intensity modification (shifting and scaling) existed leading to optimal segmentation results. This was further proven by an optimization analysis to find the optimal adjustment for an individual input evaluation sample within each normalization configuration. Discussion: The findings suggest that proper preparation of the evaluation data is more crucial than the exact choice of normalization method to prepare the training data. The histogram equalization methods tested in this study were found to perform this task best, although leaving room for further improvements, as shown by the optimization analysis.},

We undertook a large epidemiological study of rotator cuff pathology in the United Kingdom using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. The incidence of rotator cuff pathology was 87 per 100,000 person-years. It was more common in women than in men (90 cases per 100,000 person-years in women and 83 per 100,000 person-years in men; p 0.001). The highest incidence of 198 per 100,000 person-years was found in those aged between 55 and 59 years. The regional distribution of incidence demonstrated an even spread across 13 UK health authorities except Wales, where the incidence was significantly higher (122 per 100,000 person-years; p 0.001). The lowest socioeconomic group had the highest incidence (98 per 100,000 person-years). The incidence has risen fourfold since 1987 and as of 2006 shows no signs of plateauing. This study represents the largest general population study of rotator cuff pathology reported to date. The results obtained provide an enhanced appreciation of the epidemiology of rotator cuff pathology and may help to direct future upper limb orthopaedic services.},

abstract = {PURPOSE.: To describe a clinical grading system for epidemiological investigation of presumed contact lens related microbial keratitis (MK) and investigate the relationship to associated costs and disease duration. METHODS.: Eligible cases identified via surveillance required positive culture or presence of at least one clinical criterion: part of the lesion within the central 4 mm of the cornea, any anterior chamber reaction, or significant pain. Two reviewers graded cases as severe MK with vision loss (two lines), severe MK without vision loss (positive culture or central location, peripheral but 2 mm or with a hypopyon) or mild MK (remainder). The medical care, pathology, and medications comprised direct costs and loss of income, assistance of carers, and purchase of spectacles comprised indirect costs; these were calculated in Australian dollars (AU{\$}). Duration of disease was estimated from duration of symptoms (days). Outcome measures were compared between categories using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS.: There were 47 of 278 (16.3{\%}) severe with vision loss, 137 of 278 (49.3{\%}) severe without vision loss, and 94 of 278 (33.8{\%}) mild MK. The disease duration was 18 (6 to 95) [median (inter-quartile range)] for severe cases with vision loss, 7 (4 to 14) for severe cases without vision loss, and 4 (3 to 7) days for mild MK (ANOVA, p 0.001). Associated costs were AU{\$}5515 (2784 to 9437) for severe cases with vision loss, AU{\$}1596 (774 to 4888) for severe cases without vision loss, and AU{\$}795 (527 to 1234) for the mild MK (ANOVA, p 0.001). Costs and symptom duration were greatest for severe disease with vision loss, less for the severe disease without vision loss, and lowest for the mild disease (p 0.003). CONCLUSIONS.: The comparison of disease burden lends support to this clinical grading system and the concept that the severity of MK can be stratified to identify those that might be of non-infectious etiology or have a microbial cause of low virulence with minimal morbidity. 2008 American Academy of Optometry.},

In addition to being immediately disadvantageous, myopia increases the risk of serious disorders such as myopic macular degeneration, retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataract and is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness across many countries. The reduction in age of onset of myopia is of great concern since the earlier the onset, the more myopic the individual will become, with all the attendant increased risks of accompanying debilitating eye conditions. The economic burden is great; both in consequences of uncorrected refractive error and also in the provision of devices for correcting visual acuity. Earlier onset of myopia increases the lifetime economic burden related to loss of productivity and independence, leading to a reduced quality of life. Recent data suggest addressing accommodation per se has little direct amelioration of myopia progression. Pharmacological interventions that effect changes in the sclera show promising efficacy, whereas optical interventions based on a myopic shift in the retinal image are proving to effect up to 55{\%} reduction in the rate of progression of myopia. Early contact lens and spectacle interventions that reduce the rate of progression of myopia are able to significantly reduce the burden of myopia. These non-pharmacological interventions show profound promise in reducing the overall associated morbidity of myopia. 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The automatic analysis of the 3D optical microscopic images containing neuron cells remains one of the central challenges in the mod-ern computational neuroscience. The varying image qualities make the accurate detection of the curvilinear neuronal arbours elusive. The high computational cost raised by large 3D image volumes also makes the con-ventional filter-bank learning methods impractical. We present a novel Triple-Crossing (TC) 2.5D convolutional neural network to detect the neuronal arbours in large 3D microscopic volumes with a reasonable com-putational cost. The network is trained to output a regression map that indicates the presence of the neuronal arbours. The proposed methods can be used as a pre-processing step in an automated neuronal circuit reconstruction pipeline, which enables the collection of large-scale neuron morphological datasets. In our experiments, we show that the proposed methods could effectively eliminate dense background noises and fix the gaps along neuronal arbours. The proposed methods could also outper-form the original 2.5D neural network regarding the training efficiency as well as the generalisation performance.},

@article{Key2007,
abstract = {The concept of applying a lens to the cornea as a refractive appliance was first proposed in the early 19th century. By 1888, glass scleral lenses for the correction of optical defects and irregularities were manufactured and used. New materials, especially soft hydrogel lenses and rigid gas-permeable lenses, became available in the 20th century and allowed comfortable contact lenses to be made in any design needed. By the 21st century, the increasing use of silicone hydrogel lenses to address the oxygen need of the cornea has led to increased worldwide use. Of the 125 million global contact lens wearers, most are female and relatively young. Soft lenses are by far the dominant modality used, with silicone hydrogel lenses taking an increasing share of new fittings, particularly for overnight wear. Microbial keratitis, although relatively uncommon, remains the most serious potential complication for these lens wearers. Ongoing basic research, more powerful antimicrobial agents, and the development of safer lens materials are helping to alleviate this problem. 2007 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Much effort goes into the design, synthesis, and fabrication of biomaterials and devices to ensure that they have the appropriate mechanical properties, durability, and functionality. The bulk composition and organization of materials govern these properties. Surface modifications are widely applied to modulate or enhance the biointeractions of biomedical devices and improve other aspects of performance. Surface modification is used in the laboratory setting, and also for the treatment of medical devices used in the clinic. Since a medical device may already have appropriate physical properties and be well-understood in the clinic, surface modification provides a means to alter only the biointeractions of the device without the need for redesign, retooling for manufacture, and retraining of medical personnel.},

Contact lens materials have significantly evolved over time to minimize adverse effects associated with contact lens wearing, to maintain a regular corneal metabolism, and to preserve tear film stability. This article encompasses contact lens technology, including materials, chemical and physical properties, manufacturing processes, microbial contamination, and ocular complications. The function and the composition of the tear fluid are discussed to assess its potential as a diagnostic media. The regulatory standards of contact lens devices with regard to biocompatibility and contact lens market are presented. Future prospects in contact lens technology are evaluated, with particular interest given to theranostic applications for in situ continuous monitoring the ocular physiology.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
